.sp
The \fBxtrabackup\fP binary is a compiled C program that is linked with the \fIInnoDB\fP
libraries and the standard \fIMySQL\fP client libraries. The \fIInnoDB\fP libraries
provide functionality necessary to apply a log to data files, and the \fIMySQL\fP
client libraries provide command\-line option parsing, configuration file
parsing, and so on to give the binary a familiar look and feel.
.sp
The tool runs in either \fBxtrabackup \-\-backup\fP or
\fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP mode, corresponding to the two main
functions it performs. There are several variations on these functions
to accomplish different tasks, and there are two less commonly used
modes, \fBxtrabackup \-\-stats\fP and \fBxtrabackup \-\-print\-param\fP\&.
.SH OTHER TYPES OF BACKUPS
.SS Incremental Backups
.sp
Both \fBxtrabackup\fP and \fBinnobackupex\fP tools supports incremental backups, which
means that it can copy only the data that has changed since the last full
backup. You can perform many incremental backups between each full backup, so
you can set up a backup process such as a full backup once a week and an
incremental backup every day, or full backups every day and incremental backups
every hour.
.sp
Incremental backups work because each InnoDB page (usually 16kb in size)
contains a log sequence number, or LSN\&. The LSN is the system
version number for the entire database. Each page\(aqs LSN shows how
recently it was changed. An incremental backup copies each page whose
LSN is newer than the previous incremental or full backup\(aqs
LSN\&. There are two algorithms in use to find the set of such pages to be
copied. The first one, available with all the server types and versions, is to
check the page LSN directly by reading all the data pages. The second
one, available with \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP, is to enable the \fI\%changed page tracking\fP
feature on the server, which will note the pages as they are being changed. This
information will be then written out in a compact separate so\-called bitmap
file. The \fBxtrabackup\fP binary will use that file to read only the data pages it
needs for the incremental backup, potentially saving many read requests. The
latter algorithm is enabled by default if the \fBxtrabackup\fP binary finds the
bitmap file. It is possible to specify \fBxtrabackup
\-\-incremental\-force\-scan\fP to read all the pages even if the bitmap data is
available.
.sp
Incremental backups do not actually compare the data files to the previous
backup\(aqs data files. In fact, you can use \fBxtrabackup \-\-incremental\-lsn\fP
to perform an incremental backup without even having the previous backup, if you
know its LSN\&. Incremental backups simply read the pages and compare
their LSN to the last backup\(aqs LSN\&. You still need a full backup
to recover the incremental changes, however; without a full backup to act as a
base, the incremental backups are useless.
.SS Creating an Incremental Backup
.sp
To make an incremental backup, begin with a full backup as usual. The
\fBxtrabackup\fP binary writes a file called \fBxtrabackup_checkpoints\fP into the
backup\(aqs target directory. This file contains a line showing the \fBto_lsn\fP,
which is the database\(aqs LSN at the end of the backup. Create the
full backup with a command such as the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-backup \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/base \-\-datadir=/var/lib/mysql/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want a usable full backup, use innobackupex since \fIxtrabackup\fP itself won\(aqt copy
table definitions, triggers, or anything else that\(aqs not .ibd.
.sp
If you look at the \fBxtrabackup_checkpoints\fP file, you should see some
contents similar to the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
backup_type = full\-backuped
from_lsn = 0
to_lsn = 1291135
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that you have a full backup, you can make an incremental backup based on
it. Use a command such as the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-backup \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/inc1 \e
\-\-incremental\-basedir=/data/backups/base \-\-datadir=/var/lib/mysql/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB/data/backups/inc1/\fP directory should now contain delta files, such
as \fBibdata1.delta\fP and \fBtest/table1.ibd.delta\fP\&. These represent the
changes since the \fBLSN 1291135\fP\&. If you examine the
\fBxtrabackup_checkpoints\fP file in this directory, you should see something
similar to the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
backup_type = incremental
from_lsn = 1291135
to_lsn = 1291340
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The meaning should be self\-evident. It\(aqs now possible to use this directory as
the base for yet another incremental backup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-backup \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/inc2 \e
\-\-incremental\-basedir=/data/backups/inc1 \-\-datadir=/var/lib/mysql/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Preparing the Incremental Backups
.sp
The \fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP step for incremental backups is not the same
as for normal backups. In normal backups, two types of operations are performed
to make the database consistent: committed transactions are replayed from the
log file against the data files, and uncommitted transactions are rolled
back. You must skip the rollback of uncommitted transactions when preparing a
backup, because transactions that were uncommitted at the time of your backup
may be in progress, and it\(aqs likely that they will be committed in the next
incremental backup. You should use the \fBxtrabackup \-\-apply\-log\-only\fP
option to prevent the rollback phase.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you do not use the \fBxtrabackup \-\-apply\-log\-only\fP option to
prevent the rollback phase, then your incremental backups will be
useless. After transactions have been rolled back, further incremental
backups cannot be applied.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Beginning with the full backup you created, you can prepare it, and then apply
the incremental differences to it. Recall that you have the following backups:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/data/backups/base
/data/backups/inc1
/data/backups/inc2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To prepare the base backup, you need to run \fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP as
usual, but prevent the rollback phase:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-prepare \-\-apply\-log\-only \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/base
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The output should end with some text such as the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
101107 20:49:43  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1291135
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The log sequence number should match the \fBto_lsn\fP of the base backup, which
you saw previously.
.sp
This backup is actually safe to restore as\-is now,
even though the rollback phase has been skipped. If you restore it and start
\fIMySQL\fP, \fIInnoDB\fP will detect that the rollback phase was not performed, and it
will do that in the background, as it usually does for a crash recovery upon
start. It will notify you that the database was not shut down normally.
.sp
To apply the first incremental backup to the full backup, you should use the
following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-prepare \-\-apply\-log\-only \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/base \e
\-\-incremental\-dir=/data/backups/inc1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This applies the delta files to the files in \fB/data/backups/base\fP, which
rolls them forward in time to the time of the incremental backup. It then
applies the redo log as usual to the result. The final data is in
\fB/data/backups/base\fP, not in the incremental directory. You should see
some output such as the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
incremental backup from 1291135 is enabled.
xtrabackup: cd to /data/backups/base/
xtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared.

101107 20:56:30  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1291340
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Again, the LSN should match what you saw from your earlier inspection of the
first incremental backup. If you restore the files from
\fB/data/backups/base\fP, you should see the state of the database as of the
first incremental backup.
.sp
Preparing the second incremental backup is a similar process: apply the deltas
to the (modified) base backup, and you will roll its data forward in time to the
point of the second incremental backup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-prepare \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/base \e
\-\-incremental\-dir=/data/backups/inc2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBxtrabackup \-\-apply\-log\-only\fP should be used when merging all
incrementals except the last one. That\(aqs why the previous line doesn\(aqt
contain the \fBxtrabackup \-\-apply\-log\-only\fP option. Even if the
\fBxtrabackup \-\-apply\-log\-only\fP was used on the last step, backup would
still be consistent but in that case server would perform the rollback phase.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you wish to avoid the notice that \fIInnoDB\fP was not shut down normally, when
xoyou applied the desired deltas to the base backup, you can run
\fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP again without disabling the rollback phase.
.SS Partial Backups
.sp
\fBxtrabackup\fP supports taking partial backups when the
innodb_file_per_table option is enabled. There are three ways to create
partial backups:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
matching the tables names with a regular expression
.IP 2. 3
providing a list of table names in a file
.IP 3. 3
providing a list of databases
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If any of the matched or listed tables is deleted during the
backup, \fBxtrabackup\fP will fail.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the purposes of this manual page, we will assume that there is a database
named \fBtest\fP which contains tables named \fBt1\fP and \fBt2\fP\&.
.SS Using \fBxtrabackup \-\-tables\fP
.sp
The first method involves the \fBxtrabackup \-\-tables\fP option. The option\(aqs
value is a regular expression that is matched against the fully qualified
tablename, including the database name, in the form \fBdatabasename.tablename\fP\&.
.sp
To back up only tables in the \fBtest\fP database, you can use the
following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.sp
To back up only the table \fBtest.t1\fP, you can use the following command:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using \fBxtrabackup \-\-tables\-file\fP
.sp
\fBxtrabackup \-\-tables\-file\fP specifies a file that can contain multiple
table names, one table name per line in the file. Only the tables named in the
file will be backed up. Names are matched exactly, case\-sensitive, with no
pattern or regular expression matching. The table names must be fully qualified,
in \fBdatabasename.tablename\fP format.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using \fBxtrabackup \-\-databases\fP and \fBxtrabackup \-\-databases\-file\fP
.sp
\fBxtrabackup \-\-databases\fP accepts a space\-separated list of the databases
and tables to backup in the format \fBdatabasename[.tablename]\fP\&. In addition to
this list make sure to specify the \fBmysql\fP, \fBsys\fP, and
\fBperformance_schema\fP databases. These databases are required when restoring
the databases using \fBxtrabackup \-\-copy\-back\fP\&.

.sp
\fBxtrabackup \-\-databases\-file\fP specifies a file that can contain multiple
databases and tables in the \fBdatabasename[.tablename]\fP form, one element name
per line in the file. Only named databases and tables will be backed up. Names
are matched exactly, case\-sensitive, with no pattern or regular expression
matching.
.SS Preparing the Backup
.sp
When you use the \fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP option on a partial backup, you
will see warnings about tables that don\(aqt exist. This is because these tables
exist in the data dictionary inside InnoDB, but the corresponding \&.ibd
files don\(aqt exist. They were not copied into the backup directory. These tables
will be removed from the data dictionary, and when you restore the backup and
start InnoDB, they will no longer exist and will not cause any errors or
warnings to be printed to the log file.
.sp
An example of the error message you will see during the prepare phase
follows.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
InnoDB: Reading tablespace information from the .ibd files...

.ft P

.SH ADVANCED FEATURES
.SS Throttling Backups
.sp
Although \fBxtrabackup\fP does not block your database\(aqs operation, any backup can add
load to the system being backed up. On systems that do not have much spare I/O
capacity, it might be helpful to throttle the rate at which \fBxtrabackup\fP reads and
writes data. You can do this with the \fBxtrabackup \-\-throttle\fP
option. This option limits the number of chunks copied per second. The chunk
size is \fI10 MB\fP\&.
.sp
The image below shows how throttling works when \fBxtrabackup
\-\-throttle\fP is set to 1.
[image]
.sp
By default, there is no throttling, and \fBxtrabackup\fP reads and writes data as
quickly as it can. If you set too strict of a limit on the IOPS, the backup
might be so slow that it will never catch up with the transaction logs that
InnoDB is writing, so the backup might never complete.
.SS Scripting Backups With xtrabackup
.sp
The \fBxtrabackup\fP tool has several features to enable scripts to control
it while they perform related tasks. The innobackupex script is one example, but \fBxtrabackup\fP
is easy to control with your own command\-line scripts too.
.SS Suspending After Copying
.sp
In backup mode, \fBxtrabackup\fP normally copies the log files in a
background thread, copies the data files in a foreground thread, and then stops
the log copying thread and finishes. As long as that file exists, xtrabackup
will continue to watch the log files and copy them into the
\fBxtrabackup_logfile\fP in the target directory. When the file is removed,
\fBxtrabackup\fP will finish copying the log file and exit.
.sp
This functionality is useful for coordinating the InnoDB data backups with other
actions. Perhaps the most obvious is copying the table definitions (the
\fB\&.frm\fP files) so that the backup can be restored. You can start
\fBxtrabackup\fP in the background, wait for the
\fBxtrabackup_suspended\fP file to be created, and then copy any other files
you need to complete the backup. This is exactly what the innobackupex tool does (it also copies MyISAM data and
other files).
.SS Generating Meta\-Data
.sp
It is a good idea for the backup to include all the information you need to
restore the backup. The \fBxtrabackup\fP tool can print out the contents of
a \fBmy.cnf\fP file that are needed to restore the data and log files.
\fBxtrabackup \-\-print\-param\fP prints out something like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# This MySQL options file was generated by XtraBackup.

innodb_data_home_dir = /data/innodb/
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /data/innodb\-logs/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can redirect this output into a file in the target directory of the backup.
.SS Agreeing on the Source Directory
.sp
It\(aqs possible that the presence of a defaults file or other factors could cause
\fBxtrabackup\fP to back up data from a different location than you
expected. To prevent this, you can use \fBxtrabackup \-\-print\-param\fP to ask
it where it will be copying data from. You can use the output to ensure that
\fBxtrabackup\fP and your script are working on the same dataset.
.SS Analyzing Table Statistics
.sp
The \fBxtrabackup\fP binary can analyze InnoDB data files in read\-only mode to give
statistics about them. To do this, you should use the \fBxtrabackup
\-\-stats\fP option. You can combine this with the \fBxtrabackup \-\-tables\fP
option to limit the files to examine. It also uses the \fBxtrabackup
\-\-use\-memory\fP option.
.sp
You can perform the analysis on a running server, with some chance of errors due
to the data being changed during analysis. Or, you can analyze a backup copy of
the database. Either way, to use the statistics feature, you need a clean copy
of the database including correctly sized log files, so you need to execute with
\fBxtrabackup \-\-prepare\fP twice to use this functionality on a backup.
.sp
The result of running on a backup might look like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.IP \(bu 2
The first line simply shows the table and index name and its internal
identifiers. If you see an index named \fBGEN_CLUST_INDEX\fP, that is the
table\(aqs clustered index, automatically created because you did not explicitly
create a \fBPRIMARY KEY\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The estimated statistics in dictionary information is similar to the data
that\(aqs gathered through \fBANALYZE TABLE\fP inside of \fIInnoDB\fP to be stored as
estimated cardinality statistics and passed to the query optimizer.
.IP \(bu 2
The real statistics information is the result of scanning the data pages and
computing exact information about the index.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBThe level <X> pages\fP: output means that the line shows information about
pages at that level in the index tree. The larger \fB<X>\fP is, the farther it
is from the leaf pages, which are level 0. The first line is the root page.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBleaf pages\fP output shows the leaf pages, of course. This is where the
table\(aqs data is stored.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBexternal pages\fP: output (not shown) shows large external pages that
hold values too long to fit in the row itself, such as long \fBBLOB\fP and
\fBTEXT\fP values.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBrecs\fP is the real number of records (rows) in leaf pages.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBpages\fP is the page count.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBdata\fP is the total size of the data in the pages, in bytes.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBdata/pages\fP is calculated as (\fBdata\fP / (\fBpages\fP * \fBPAGE_SIZE\fP)) *
100%. It will never reach 100% because of space reserved for page headers and
footers.

The columns are the table and index, followed by the total number of pages in
that index, the number of pages not actually occupied by data, and the number of
bytes of real data as a percentage of the total size of the pages of real
data. The first line in the above output, in which the \fBINDEX\fP column is
empty, is a summary of the entire table.
.SS Working with Binary Logs
.sp
The \fBxtrabackup\fP binary integrates with information that \fIInnoDB\fP stores in
its transaction log about the corresponding binary log position for committed
transactions. This enables it to print out the binary log position to which a
backup corresponds, so you can use it to set up new replication slaves or
perform point\-in\-time recovery.
.SS Finding the Binary Log Position
.sp
You can find the binary log position corresponding to a backup once the backup
has been prepared. This can be done by either running \fBxtrabackup
\-\-prepare\fP or \fBinnobackupex \-\-apply\-log\fP\&. If your backup is from a
server with binary logging enabled, \fBxtrabackup\fP will create a file named
\fBxtrabackup_binlog_info\fP in the target directory. This file contains the
binary log file name and position of the exact point in the binary log to which
the prepared backup corresponds.
.sp
You will also see output similar to the following during the \fBprepare\fP stage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
InnoDB: Last MySQL binlog file position 0 3252710, file name ./mysql\-bin.000001
\&... snip ...
[notice (again)]
  If you use binary log and don\(aqt use any hack of group commit,
  the binary log position seems to be:
InnoDB: Last MySQL binlog file position 0 3252710, file name ./mysql\-bin.000001
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This output can also be found in the \fBxtrabackup_binlog_pos_innodb\fP file,
but \fBit is only correct\fP when no other than \fIXtraDB\fP or \fIInnoDB\fP are used as
storage engines.
.sp
If other storage engines are used (i.e. \fIMyISAM\fP), you should use the
\fBxtrabackup_binlog_info\fP file to retrieve the position.
.sp
The message about hacking group commit refers to an early implementation of
emulated group commit in \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP\&.
.SS Point\-In\-Time Recovery
.sp
To perform a point\-in\-time recovery from an \fBxtrabackup\fP backup, you should
prepare and restore the backup, and then replay binary logs from the point shown
in the \fBxtrabackup_binlog_info\fP file.
.sp
A more detailed procedure is found here (with \fBinnobackupex\fP).
.SS Setting Up a New Replication Slave
.sp
To set up a new replica, you should prepare the backup, and restore it to the
data directory of your new replication slave. Then in your \fBCHANGE MASTER TO\fP
command, use the binary log filename and position shown in the
\fBxtrabackup_binlog_info\fP file to start replication.
.sp
A more detailed procedure is found in \&../howtos/setting_up_replication\&.
.SS Restoring Individual Tables
.sp
In server versions prior to 5.6, it is not possible to copy tables between
servers by copying the files, even with innodb_file_per_table\&. However,
with \fIPercona XtraBackup\fP, you can export individual tables from any \fIInnoDB\fP
database, and import them into \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP with \fIXtraDB\fP or \fIMySQL\fP 5.6.
(The source doesn\(aqt have to be \fIXtraDB\fP or or \fIMySQL\fP 5.6, but the destination
does.) This only works on individual \&.ibd files, and cannot export a
table that is not contained in its own \&.ibd file.
.sp
Let\(aqs see how to export and import the following table:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
CREATE TABLE export_test (
  a int(11) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you\(aqre running \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP version older than 5.5.10\-20.1, variable
\fI\%innodb_expand_import\fP
should be used instead of \fI\%innodb_import_table_from_xtrabackup\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Exporting the Table
.sp
This table should have been created in innodb_file_per_table mode, so
after taking a backup as usual with \fBxtrabackup \-\-backup\fP, the
\&.ibd file should exist in the target directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ find /data/backups/mysql/ \-name export_test.*
/data/backups/mysql/test/export_test.ibd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
when you prepare the backup, add the extra parameter
\fBxtrabackup \-\-export\fP to the command. Here is an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ xtrabackup \-\-prepare \-\-export \-\-target\-dir=/data/backups/mysql/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you\(aqre trying to restore encrypted InnoDB tablespace table you\(aqll need to specify the
keyring file as well:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
xtrabackup \-\-prepare \-\-export \-\-target\-dir=/tmp/table \e
\-\-keyring\-file\-data=/var/lib/mysql\-keyring/keyring
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you should see a \&.exp file in the target directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ find /data/backups/mysql/ \-name export_test.*
/data/backups/mysql/test/export_test.exp
/data/backups/mysql/test/export_test.ibd
/data/backups/mysql/test/export_test.cfg
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These three files are all you need to import the table into a server running
\fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP with \fIXtraDB\fP or \fIMySQL\fP 5.7. In case server is using \fI\%InnoDB
Tablespace Encryption\fP
additional \fB\&.cfp\fP file be listed for encrypted tables.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIMySQL\fP uses \fB\&.cfg\fP file which contains \fIInnoDB\fP dictionary dump in
special format. This format is different from the \fB\&.exp\(ga\fP one which is
used in \fIXtraDB\fP for the same purpose. Strictly speaking, a \fB\&.cfg\(ga\fP
file is not required to import a tablespace to \fIMySQL\fP 5.7 or \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP 5.7. A tablespace will be imported successfully even if it is from
another server, but \fIInnoDB\fP will do schema validation if the corresponding
\fB\&.cfg\fP file is present in the same directory.

.SS Importing the Table
.sp
On the destination server running \fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP with \fIXtraDB\fP and
\fI\%innodb_import_table_from_xtrabackup\fP
option enabled, or \fIMySQL\fP 5.6, create a table with the same structure, and
then perform the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Execute \fBALTER TABLE test.export_test DISCARD TABLESPACE;\fP
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you see the following message, then you must enable
innodb_file_per_table and create the table again: \fBERROR 1030
(HY000): Got error \-1 from storage engine\fP
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Copy the exported files to the \fBtest/\fP subdirectory of the destination
server\(aqs data directory
.IP \(bu 2
Execute \fBALTER TABLE test.export_test IMPORT TABLESPACE;\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The table should now be imported, and you should be able to \fBSELECT\fP from it
and see the imported data.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Persistent statistics for imported tablespace will be empty until you run the
\fBANALYZE TABLE\fP on the imported table. They will be empty because they are
stored in the system tables \fBmysql.innodb_table_stats\fP and
\fBmysql.innodb_index_stats\fP and they aren\(aqt updated by server during the
import. This is due to upstream bug \fI\%#72368\fP\&.

.SS LRU dump backup
.sp
This feature reduces the warm up time by restoring buffer pool state from \fBib_lru_dump\fP file after restart. \fIPercona XtraBackup\fP discovers \fBib_lru_dump\fP and backs it up automatically.
[image]
.sp
If the buffer restore option is enabled in \fBmy.cnf\fP buffer pool will be in the warm state after backup is restored. To enable this set the variable \fI\%innodb_buffer_pool_restore_at_startup\fP =1 in Percona Server 5.5 or \fI\%innodb_auto_lru_dump\fP =1 in Percona Server 5.1.
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.SS Implementation Details
.sp
This page contains notes on various internal aspects of the \fBxtrabackup\fP tool\(aqs
operation.
.SS File Permissions
.sp
\fBxtrabackup\fP opens the source data files in read\-write mode, although it does
not modify the files. This means that you must run \fBxtrabackup\fP as a user who
has permission to write the data files. The reason for opening the files in
read\-write mode is that \fBxtrabackup\fP uses the embedded \fIInnoDB\fP libraries to
open and read the files, and \fIInnoDB\fP opens them in read\-write mode because it
normally assumes it is going to write to them.
.SS Tuning the OS Buffers
.sp
Because \fBxtrabackup\fP reads large amounts of data from the filesystem, it uses
\fBposix_fadvise()\fP where possible, to instruct the operating system not to try
to cache the blocks it reads from disk. Without this hint, the operating system
would prefer to cache the blocks, assuming that \fBxtrabackup\fP is likely to need
them again, which is not the case. Caching such large files can place pressure
on the operating system\(aqs virtual memory and cause other processes, such as the
database server, to be swapped out. The \fBxtrabackup\fP tool avoids this with the
following hint on both the source and destination files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
posix_fadvise(file, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, xtrabackup asks the operating system to perform more aggressive
read\-ahead optimizations on the source files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
posix_fadvise(file, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Copying Data Files
.sp
When copying the data files to the target directory, \fBxtrabackup\fP reads and
writes 1MB of data at a time. This is not configurable. When copying the log
file, \fBxtrabackup\fP reads and writes 512 bytes at a time. This is also not
possible to configure, and matches InnoDB\(aqs behavior (workaround exists in
\fIPercona Server for MySQL\fP because it has an option to tune
\fBinnodb_log_block_size\fP for \fIXtraDB\fP, and in that case \fIPercona XtraBackup\fP will
match the tuning).
.sp
After reading from the files, \fBxtrabackup\fP iterates over the 1MB buffer a page
at a time, and checks for page corruption on each page with InnoDB\(aqs
\fBbuf_page_is_corrupted()\fP function. If the page is corrupt, it re\-reads and
retries up to 10 times for each page. It skips this check on the doublewrite
buffer.
.SS \fBxtrabackup\fP Exit Codes
.sp
The \fBxtrabackup\fP binary exits with the traditional success value of 0 after a backup when no error occurs. If an error occurs during the backup, the exit value is 1.
.sp
In certain cases, the exit value can be something other than 0 or 1, due to the command\-line option code included from the \fIMySQL\fP libraries. An unknown command\-line option, for example, will cause an exit code of 255.

.B \-\-close\-files
Do not keep files opened. When \fBxtrabackup\fP opens tablespace it normally
doesn\(aqt close its file handle in order to handle the DDL operations
correctly. However, if the number of tablespaces is really huge and can not
fit into any limit, there is an option to close file handles once they are
no longer accessed. \fIPercona XtraBackup\fP can produce inconsistent backups
with this option enabled. Use at your own risk.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compress
This option tells \fBxtrabackup\fP to compress all output data, including the
transaction log file and meta data files, using the specified compression
algorithm. The only currently supported algorithm is \fBquicklz\fP\&. The
resulting files have the qpress archive format, i.e. every \fB*.qp\fP file
produced by xtrabackup is essentially a one\-file qpress archive and can be
extracted and uncompressed by the \fI\%qpress\fP  file
archiver.
.UNINDENT

compression (:option:\(ga xtrabackup \-\-compress\-threads\(ga) can be used together
with parallel file copying (\fI\%xtrabackup \-\-parallel\fP). For example,

If there are still such queries when the timeout expires, xtrabackup
terminates with an error. Default is \fB0\fP, in which case it does not wait
